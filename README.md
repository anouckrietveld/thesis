# thesis

This repository contains my bachelor thesis for the BSc Econometrics at the University of Amsterdam. In this thesis I developed a simulation pricing model, where two firms use a Q-learning algorithm to set their price. Previous literature has shown that when firms use machine learning algorithms, there is a potential for collusion in the market. Until now, this only has been investigated by letting firms in a simulation have symmetric pricing frequencies. This thesis diverges from that approach by letting firms have an asymmetry in their price adjusting frequency. 

Abstract

Firms increasingly use algorithms to price services and goods in online and offline markets.
Recent studies show that using pricing technologies can result in collusion, which is
detrimental to consumers. This thesis experimentally examines whether collusion occurs in
a duopoly market where firms use asymmetric pricing frequencies. The findings suggest that
supra-competitive outcomes do arise. However, the algorithms do not always converge to
an equilibrium. Additionally, the average price levels set by both firms are higher when one
firm has a faster pricing frequency compared to the setting where pricing frequencies are
symmetric. These findings show that it is essential when investigating algorithmic collusion
to account for heterogeneity in frequency technologies. Further research is necessary to develop
adequate policies and laws concerning algorithmic collusion.
